\section{Conclusion}
\par
The design and development of an automated discharge collection for the synthetic hydro experimental machine were fully realized. This project had three specific objectives;
\begin{itemize}
    \item To design an automated discharge flow control mechanism that could turn the ball valve in steps of less than a degree
    \item To design and fabricate a discharge handling mechanism incorporated with automatic weight, time, and temperature measurement
    \item To design a graphical user interface along with a robust control algorithm to integrate all the unit
\end{itemize}
\par
All three objectives were fully met. For the first objective, the system could precisely control the flow rate in the required step as input from the user interface. For the second objective, the discharge handling mechanism was able to divert the discharge as intended. Furthermore, the weight and temperature measurement units were able to record and send correct real-time values into the user interface for display. Finally, a graphical user interface was realized that could allow for both manual and automatic operation of the machine. The system could further be able to communicate to the desktop graphical user application via Ethernet support.
\subsection{Recommendation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Incorporation of a solenoid valve for emptying the tank and the use of barometric pressure sensors to make the system fully automated.
\end{itemize}
