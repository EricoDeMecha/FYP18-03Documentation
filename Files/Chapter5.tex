\section{Conclusion}
\par
The objective of this project was to design a mechatronic system to automate the discharge collection process during an experiment on the Synthetic Hydro-Experimental machine currently in use in JKUAT. The design was required to be a plug-and-play unit and to retain the credibility of the experiment. The system design was divided into three sections: the design of the discharge flow control unit, the discharge handling unit, the interface and control unit. Mechanical parts were designed and tested with major consideration of the electronics. The electrical connections for the electronics were also designed. Finally, an interface with system's controls was designed.  
\par
This phase only involved the design work which has been done conclusively. However, budget has been the most constraining factor in the design. Inferior electronics and designs have been selected since their suitable alternatives are expensive relative to the budget. It is recommended that the school funds the total cost of such project.  
\par
The next phase of the project will involve the fabrication of the developed designs. However, it is expected that during this phase, few modifications and redesigns will have to be done to further optimize the design.
